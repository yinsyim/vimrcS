# Yui

## Description

https://vim-yui.netlify.com/

Experimental color scheme without any colors, except what's required to display a meaningful `diff`.
All syntax differentiation is achieved through font styles, so your terminal needs to support bold and italic text.

Shades are used for things like dimming folded text.

## Something Looks Weird!

This is not yet a finished color scheme. If you spot any issues, please create an issue! Ideally you include an example file and/or screenshot.
